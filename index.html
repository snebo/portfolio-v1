                <p><strong>I'm a Fifth year student at Olusegun Agagu University</strong> in Nigeria studying industrial
                    mathematical
                    and mathematical modeling. I have experience developing and designing software for web, from simple
                    landing
                    pages to progress web applications and APIs.
                    I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under heavy traffic, but also
                    optimize
                    an
                    implements optimal datastructures to create a smooth user experience'</p>
                <p>I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experences with clean, efficient, and
                    scalable
                    code. I onsider work an ongoing education, and
                    I'm always lookign for oppournities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as
                    much
                    as I
                    want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create
                    someting that in one way or another helps others solve problems or achive their goals.</p>
                <p><strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, </strong>I'm probably somewhere reading a manga,
                    hanging
                    out with friends or pets or thinkering with digital devices.</p>
